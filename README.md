# knockout-es6
Based on Steve Sanderson's [knockout-es5](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout-es5/)

**Still a work in progress**

Right now, this is simply a clone of the ES5 version that is packaged as an ES6 module.  All functionality and all tests are copied directly from the original. *This will change in the future.*
